# ffxiv-login-attempter
## How to use:
0. Make sure you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed, and also, that you're using XIVLauncher and not the official launcher. Otherwise this won't work.
1. Download this repository as a ZIP and extract to a folder.
2. Edit relogin.py, changing the value of `ffxiv_executable` to the path of your XIVLauncher executable.
2. Double click `run.bat`.
3. FFXIV should launch automatically and enter the queue. If it doesn't, you may need to tweak something.

## Disclaimer
Probably won't work on a 1080p monitor unless you adjust the `offsetY` on line 89, and it won't work when you're tabbed out of ffxiv.
