# ffxiv-login-attempter
## How to use:
0. Make sure you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed, and also, that you're using XIVLauncher and not the official launcher. Otherwise this won't work.
1. Download this repository as a ZIP and extract to a folder.
2. Edit relogin.py, changing the value of `ffxiv_executable` to the path of your XIVLauncher executable.
2. Double click `run.bat`.
3. FFXIV should launch automatically and enter the queue. If it doesn't, you may need to tweak something. When you get an error, it will press the okay button, start FFXIV again, and enter the queue.

## Disclaimer
Only tested to work on 1440p monitors. It probably won't work on a 1080p monitor unless you replace all screenshots and adjust the `offsetY` on line 89.
